Device files serve as independent objects that can interface with a physical
or computational tool as well is with the APE framework.  Each file should
include a minal number of devices to keep interactions clearer.

The drivers folder is a repository for poorly commented or partially functional
Python wrappers.

To connect with the APE framework:

1.  Elemental procdures for the Device need to be set up
2.  Each elemental procedure must return a logginging string
3.  Importing libraries should be done as close to its need as reasonable

Simulation mode is a critical part of debugging both the Device and how APE
interfaces with APE so take the time to set up informative simulation
capacities.

File naming convention:

In general, the goal here is to reduce repetive development of interfaces with
specific pieces of equipment.  This is, in part, accomplished through specific
file naming standards.  Try to stick with manufacturer descriptors whenever
possible to preserve clarity.

Abstract Device concepts like Device, System, and Sensor are simply the name of
the device.

Manufacturer-specific Devices are named by:
<manufacturer name>_<specific product>
example:  aerotech_A3200.py  nordson_UltimusV.py

Increase specificity as needed with underscores seperating levels

Since languages are often living things but the specific version used by a
specfic device, do NOT use these as part of the file name

Since descriptive terms are not specific, avoid these terms when possible

All files should end with:

# For testing and debuging
if __name__ == '__main__':
    pass

In most cases, it would be helpful to put some illustrative examples in place
of "pass".

Descriptors:
These are strings like 'motion', 'pump', or 'system' that help Procedures find
the right devices.  All elements of the file name should be in this list

To add a new Device.
Copy the new device file into the 'Devices' folder.  Add an entry into the
__init__.py file.
